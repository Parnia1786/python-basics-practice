# Wall Builder

A simple Python program that prints a rectangular "wall" of a user-defined size and symbol. This project demonstrates basic Python concepts like loops, functions, input validation, and string manipulation.

## Features
- Prompts the user for the number of rows and columns (must be positive integers)
- Allows the user to choose a symbol to build the wall
- Validates user input and handles incorrect entries gracefully
- Prints a clean, rectangular wall in the console


## How to Use:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download the program file (WallBuilder.py).
3. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and go to the folder where the file is saved.
4. Run the program using this command:

   python WallBuilder.py
   
When the program starts:
Enter the number of rows (for example: 3)
Enter the number of columns (for example: 4)
Enter the symbol you want to use (for example: *)

The program will then print a grid (wall) made of your chosen symbol.
