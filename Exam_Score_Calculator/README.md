# Exam Score Calculator

## Description
This is a simple Python program that allows the user to enter multiple exam scores and calculates the average score. Based on the average, the program displays a final grade such as Excellent, Good, Pass, or Fail.

## Features
Accepts multiple exam scores from the user
Allows the user to quit input at any time by typing q
Validates inputs to ensure scores are between 0 and 100
Calculates and displays the average score
Shows a final grade based on the average result

## How It Works
The program repeatedly asks the user to enter exam scores. Each valid score is stored in a list. When the user finishes entering scores, the program calculates the average and determines the final grade using predefined score ranges.
Technologies Used
Python
Basic concepts such as loops, lists, conditional statements, and error handling

## Example
- v1 – Simple Score Calculator
- What score did you get on your exam? 85
- Grade: Good 🙂

- v2 – Multi Exam Score Tracker
- What score did you get on your 1st exam (q to quit)? 90
- What score did you get on your 2nd exam (q to quit)? 75
- What score did you get on your 3rd exam (q to quit)? 60
- What score did you get on your 4th exam (q to quit)? q

- Total exams: 3
- Scores: [90.0, 75.0, 60.0]
- Average score: 75.00
- Grade: Good 🙂

## Purpose
This project was created as a practice exercise to improve understanding of Python fundamentals and input validation logic.
